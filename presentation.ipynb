      "We compromise, exactly. We just compromise. So, we are just like trying to reach, what, how we say, agreement in the other way, what we reach? Interest-oriented. Yes, but what can we reach? We can reach an agreement or we can reach? A deal. A deal, yes, but a kind of understanding. Agreement? No. How do you say agreement in the other way in English? We've been learning this word. Consensus. Consensus. We can reach consensus, yes? So, for example, if people, they cooperate together, if they are able to accommodate a little bit, they can work on compromise, right? And, for example, they can reach, finally, consensus. Okay, or we can also use the word that we can reach a kind of the rapport, right? But, now, be careful. For example, consensus, rapport, okay, and agreement, those are, let's say, again, the words from the same group, yes, because they mean that, yes, we can understand, but we cannot use them in every context interchangeably, all right? Because, for example, of course, agreement, for example, I can say legal agreement, yes, but I cannot say legal consensus, all right? For example, I can say that we reach consensus and I can say we reach rapport, but if I talk, for example, about the situation in a team, that people, they have some problems and they cannot, for example, understand each other, okay, I can say that we have problems with rapport in a team. We will not say that we have problem with consensus, okay? So, these slight differences, please remember that they exist, all right? So, this is that. Okay, when somebody doesn't want to compromise and doesn't want to reach consensus, the person cannot do that. One of the verbs which we have learned today, like, makes people purposely angry in the games. The verb, the verb. Antagonize. Antagonize, exactly. So, person can antagonize, exactly. Sure. And, for example, if there is a situation that someone wants to, let's say, like, make the person to be afraid, to be scary. Yeah, but jeopardize is like putting to risk, yes? And I am talking about a situation that I behave in the way that I want you to feel, you know, like, threatened, okay? Or just start to be scared. Bully. Bully, very good. Of course, we can say bully. Yeah, it's going to be, like, very informal, but it's a good word. Blackmail. To blackmail. So, for example, yeah, you, you, you caught, you caught wind and you blackmailed the other party, okay? But, but this is rather, rather different meaning. So, but, okay, bully, we can use this verb. And what else? Intimidate. Yes, very good. This is another word, intimidate. We, we learned that some time ago. Okay. So, so, we can have just, like, three different situations, yes? We can try to reach compromise, we can try to compromise, and we try to reach consensus or rapport, yes? So, then we adapt, we adjust, for example, some requirements of the other party, yes? And we accommodate to the situation, okay? We make what? Those incentives we make? Concessions. We make concessions to finish faster. Who remember finish faster? Expedite. Expedite. Exactly, to expedite. And sometimes we just, we, we drive hard what? Hardball tactics. Yeah. We drive hardball again. We used hardball tactics, right? Very often we antagonize. Sometimes we try to bully or sometimes we try to intimidate people, yeah? Exactly, the other party. Okay.\n",
